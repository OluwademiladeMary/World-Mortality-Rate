### Project Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard visualizing global mortality rates from 1990 to 2019. The dashboard provides insights into total deaths, age group distribution, regional mortality patterns and death trends over time.

### Data Source
The data used in this dashboard is derived from "death_by_age.csv" dataset from health organizations

### Tools
- Excel: Data Cleaning and Analysis [Download here](https://1drv.ms/x/c/6466f9908878bb62/EWK7eIiQ-WYggGSOAgAAAAABXfdDJ3FaTvSAzme3m26jog?e=6fHEDF)

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the overall death?
- What is the death rate per each age range?
- Countries and continents with high death rate?
- Which year did we record high rate of death?

### Data Analysis
I made use of pivot table to carry out the analysis.

### Dashboard Features
- Total Mortality Statistics: Displays total deaths, categorized by age group.

- Age group distribution: Visualizes deaths by age range using a pie chart.

- Regional Mortality Map: Highlights death distribution across different continents

- Death Trends Over Time: Line graphs and trend analysis of mortality across different age groups

- Year and Country Filters: Allows filtering data based on specific years and regions.

### Results/Findings
The analysis results showed but are not limited to the below.
1. A total of 9 billion people died during this period, with the highest mortality rate among the 70+ age group and the lowest among the 5-14 age group. 
2. South-East Asia region recorded the highest number of deaths as seen on the map visual.
3. The highest number of death was recorded in year 2019, while the lowest was recorded in 1990. 
4. The last chart showed that the mortality rate for the age group under 5 has decreased over the years.
   
What could possibly be responsible for this? Better maternity care? Advancements in child health care and vaccinations? or other factors?

### Recommendations
1. Strengthen Healthcare Systems – Invest in healthcare infrastructure, especially in regions with high mortality rates like South-East Asia, to improve access to quality medical care.
2. Enhance Elderly Care – Develop policies and programs targeting the 70+ age group, such as improved geriatric healthcare, social support systems, and chronic disease management.
3. Sustain Improvements in Child Healthcare – Continue advancements in maternal and child health, including prenatal care, immunization programs, and nutrition interventions to further reduce under-5 mortality rates.
4. Investigate Mortality Trends – Conduct further research to understand why 2019 recorded the highest number of deaths and 1990 the lowest. Identifying contributing factors can help mitigate future risks.
5. Regional Health Interventions – Implement targeted health interventions in South-East Asia to address prevalent causes of death in the region.
6. Monitor and Adapt Policies – Regularly assess mortality trends and healthcare strategies to adapt policies based on emerging data and ensure continuous improvement.
7. Promote Preventive Healthcare – Encourage early disease detection, routine health checkups, and lifestyle changes to improve overall life expectancy across all age groups.
8. Leverage Technology and Innovation – Use digital health solutions, AI-driven diagnostics, and telemedicine to expand healthcare access and improve health outcomes.
